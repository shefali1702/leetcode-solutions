Problem: 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
Difficulty: Easy
Topic: Arrays, Greedy

Brute Force Approach:
- For every day, consider it as the buying day.
- Check every future day as the selling day.
- Calculate the profit for each pair and keep track of the maximum profit.

Time Complexity: O(n²)
Space Complexity: O(1)

Optimal Approach:
- Traverse the array once while maintaining the minimum stock price
  encountered so far.
- For each day's price, calculate the profit if the stock were sold on
  that day.
- Update the maximum profit whenever a larger profit is found.

Time Complexity: O(n)
Space Complexity: O(1)
